# Contributing to TypeScript

There are a variety of ways you can contribute to the TypeScript project.

## Code

We always welcome bug fixes and enhancements! Look for [issues in the `Backlog` milestone](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3ABacklog) to see what kinds of changes and improvements are needed.

**Important**: We are only able to review pull requests which have an associated issue in the `Backlog` milestone. Please make sure you've identified an issue in the `Backlog` milestone before starting work on any code changes. Pull requests that don't reference an issue in the `Backlog` milestone may be closed automatically.

## Bug Reports

If you've encountered a problem in TypeScript, please read the [FAQ for Bug Reports] first!

We accept bug reports through the [new issue report form](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/new/choose). It's important to follow one of the provided templates to ensure that your report has the information we need in it.

## Documentation

Like any project, TypeScript can always use more and better documentation.

The primary documentation artifact is the [TypeScript Handbook](https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-new-handbook). Please read its `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more information.

## Feedback and Suggestions

Feedback from TypeScript developers like you drives our planning decisions around new features and behavior changes. Specific, actionable feedback on features and changes you'd like to see is a valuable way to help us prioritize and design the TypeScript of the future.

Examples of things we love to see in bug reports or feature requests:
 * Real code you wrote that you felt should have been analyzed differently
 * Workarounds you're using today that seem less than ideal
 * Libraries you have a hard time working with because of how TypeScript works
 * Features in other languages you find yourself missing
 * Bugs that slipped through your code because TypeScript didn't check it the way you expected

## Community Support

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) is an active place with lots of discussion around TypeScript features and issues. Helping out another user to understand some TypeScript behavior or providing them with better workarounds is a great way to help your fellow developer.

The [TypeScript tag on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript) is another place to share knowledge with other developers.

# Instructions for Contributing Code

## Tips

### Faster clones

The TypeScript repository is relatively large. To save some time, you might want to clone it without the repo's full history using `git clone --depth=1`.

### Using local builds

Run `gulp` to build a version of the compiler/language service that reflects changes you've made. You can then run `node <repo-root>/built/local/tsc.js` in place of `tsc` in your project. For example, to run `tsc --watch` from within the root of the repository on a file called `test.ts`, you can run `node ./built/local/tsc.js --watch test.ts`.

## Contributing bug fixes

TypeScript is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved (labelled ["help wanted"](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or in the "Backlog milestone") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing features

Features (things that add new or improved functionality to TypeScript) may be accepted, but will need to first be approved ([labelled "help wanted"](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22 or in the "Backlog" milestone) by a TypeScript project maintainer) in the suggestion issue. Features with language design impact, or that are adequately satisfied with external tools, will not be accepted.

Design changes will not be accepted at this time. If you have a design change proposal, please log a suggestion issue.

## Legal

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request. You may visit https://cla.microsoft.com to sign digitally. Alternatively, download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf](https://opensource.microsoft.com/pdf/microsoft-contribution-license-agreement.pdf)), sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>. Be sure to include your GitHub user name along with the agreement. Once we have received the signed CLA, we'll review the request. 

## Housekeeping

Your pull request should: 

* Include a description of what your change intends to do
* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the **master** branch 
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* It is desirable, but not necessary, for the tests to pass at each commit
* Have clear commit messages 
    * e.g. "Minor refactor in goToTypeDefinition", "Fix iterated type in for-await-of", "Add test for preserveWatchOutput on command line"
* Include adequate tests 
    * At least one test should fail in the absence of your non-test code changes. If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why
    * Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change
    * Include baseline changes with your change
    * All changed code must have 100% code coverage
* Follow the code conventions described in [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines)
* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration

## Contributing `lib.d.ts` fixes

There are three relevant locations to be aware of when it comes to TypeScript's library declaration files:

* `src/lib`: the location of the sources themselves.
* `lib`: the location of the last-known-good (LKG) versions of the files which are updated periodically.
* `built/local`: the build output location, including where `src/lib` files will be copied to.

Any changes should be made to [src/lib](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/tree/master/src/lib). **Most** of these files can be updated by hand, with the exception of any generated files (see below).

Library files in `built/local/` are updated automatically by running the standard build task:

```sh
gulp
```

The files in `lib/` are used to bootstrap compilation and usually **should not** be updated unless publishing a new version or updating the LKG.

### Modifying generated library files

The files `src/lib/dom.generated.d.ts` and `src/lib/webworker.generated.d.ts` both represent type declarations for the DOM and are auto-generated. To make any modifications to them, you will have to direct changes to https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator

## Running the Tests

To run all tests, invoke the `runtests-parallel` target using gulp:

```Shell
gulp runtests-parallel
```

This will run all tests; to run only a specific subset of tests, use:

```Shell
gulp runtests --tests=<regex>
```

e.g. to run all compiler baseline tests:

```Shell
gulp runtests --tests=compiler
```

or to run a specific test: `tests\cases\compiler\2dArrays.ts` 

```Shell
gulp runtests --tests=2dArrays
```

## Debugging the tests

To debug the tests, invoke the `runtests-browser` task from gulp.
You will probably only want to debug one test at a time:

```Shell
gulp runtests-browser --tests=2dArrays
```

You can specify which browser to use for debugging. Currently, Chrome and IE are supported:

```Shell
gulp runtests-browser --tests=2dArrays --browser=chrome
```

You can debug with VS Code or Node instead with `gulp runtests --inspect=true`:

```Shell
gulp runtests --tests=2dArrays --inspect=true
```

You can also use the [provided VS Code launch configuration](./.vscode/launch.template.json) to launch a debug session for an open test file. Rename the file 'launch.json', open the test file of interest, and launch the debugger from the debug panel (or press F5).

## Adding a Test

To add a new test case, simply place a `.ts` file in `tests\cases\compiler` containing code that exemplifies the bugfix or change you are making.

These files support metadata tags in the format  `// @metaDataName: value`.
The supported names and values are the same as those supported in the compiler itself, with the addition of the `fileName` flag.
`fileName` tags delimit sections of a file to be used as separate compilation units.
They are useful for tests relating to modules.
See below for examples.

**Note** that if you have a test corresponding to a specific spec compliance item, you can place it in `tests\cases\conformance` in an appropriately-named subfolder.
**Note** that filenames here must be distinct from all other compiler testcase names, so you may have to work a bit to find a unique name if it's something common.

### Tests for multiple files

When one needs to test for scenarios which require multiple files, it is useful to use the `fileName` metadata tag as such:

```TypeScript
// @fileName: file1.ts
export function f() {
}

// @fileName: file2.ts
import { f as g } from "file1";

var x = g();
```

One can also write a project test, but it is slightly more involved.

## Managing the Baselines

Compiler testcases generate baselines that track the emitted `.js`, the errors produced by the compiler, and the type of each expression in the file. Additionally, some testcases opt in to baselining the source map output.

When a change in the baselines is detected, the test will fail. To inspect changes vs the expected baselines, use

```Shell
gulp diff
```

After verifying that the changes in the baselines are correct, run

```Shell
gulp baseline-accept
```

to establish the new baselines as the desired behavior. This will change the files in `tests\baselines\reference`, which should be included as part of your commit. It's important to carefully validate changes in the baselines.

## Localization

All strings the user may see are stored in [`diagnosticMessages.json`](./src/compiler/diagnosticMessages.json).
If you make changes to it, run `gulp generate-diagnostics` to push them to the `Diagnostic` interface in `diagnosticInformationMap.generated.ts`.

See [coding guidelines on diagnostic messages](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines#diagnostic-messages).
