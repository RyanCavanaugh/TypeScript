Questions I have that I think the developers of this project can help me with:
 * How does control flow analysis represent a circular graph? I checked the documentation server for "cfa" and "control flow"
 * How do I tell if a symbol is in the global scope? I checked the documentation server for topics referencing "symbol" and "global"
 * What is an `EscapedName`, exactly?
 * How does TypeScript distinguish between comments inside JSX text vs regular TypeScript comments? I searched for "JSX text comments emitter forEachTrailingCommentRange JSX text ranges" - The issue was that comment iteration doesn't understand JSX context and treats JSX text content as regular comments.
