Questions I have that I think the developers of this project can help me with:
 * How does control flow analysis represent a circular graph? I checked the documentation server for "cfa" and "control flow"
 * How do I tell if a symbol is in the global scope? I checked the documentation server for topics referencing "symbol" and "global"
 * What is an `EscapedName`, exactly?
